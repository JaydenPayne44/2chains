    <h2 id="Shibuya">Shibuya</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Shibuya was historically the site of a castle in which the Shibuya family resided from the 11th century through the Edo period. Following the opening of the Yamanote Line in 1885, Shibuya began to emerge as a railway terminal for southwestern Tokyo and eventually as a major commercial and entertainment center.

The village of Shibuya was incorporated in 1889 by the merger of the villages of Kami-Shibuya, Naka-Shibuya and Shimo-Shibuya within Minami-Toshima County (Toyotama County from 1896). The village covered the territory of modern-day Shibuya Station area as well as the Hiroo, Daikanyama, Aoyama, and Ebisu areas. Shibuya became a town in 1909. The town of Shibuya merged with the neighboring towns of Sendagaya (which included the modern Sendagaya, Harajuku and Jingumae areas) and Yokohama (which included the modern Yoyogi and Hatagaya areas) to form Shibuya suburban ward of Tokyo-fu (outside of the central Tokyo City) in 1932. Tokyo-fu became Tokyo Metropolis in 1943, and the present-day Shibuya-ku was established as an urban special ward on March 15, 1947.</p>
<br><br>
     <p>The Tokyu Toyoko Line opened in 1932, making Shibuya a key terminal between Tokyo and Yokohama, and was joined by the forerunner of the Keio Inokashira Line in 1933 and the forerunner of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line in 1938. One of the best-known stories concerning Shibuya is the story of Hachikō, a dog who waited on his late master at Shibuya Station every day from 1923 to 1935, eventually becoming a national celebrity for his loyalty. A statue of Hachikō was built adjacent to the station, and the surrounding Hachikō Square is now the most popular meeting point in the area.
     During the occupation of Japan, Yoyogi Park was used as a housing compound for U.S. personnel known as "Washington Heights." The U.S. military left in 1964, and much of the park was repurposed as venues for the 1964 Summer Olympics. The ward itself served as part of the athletics 50  km walk and marathon course during the 1964 games.[1]</p>
<br><br>
     <p>Shibuya has achieved great popularity among young people since the early 1980s. There are several famous fashion department stores in Shibuya. Shibuya 109 is a major shopping center near Shibuya Station, particularly famous as the origin of the kogal subculture. Called "Ichi-Maru-kyū," which translates as 1–0–9 in Japanese, the name is actually a pun on that of the corporation that owns it — Tōkyū (which sounds like 10–9 in Japanese; this is numerical substitution, a form of goroawase wordplay). The contemporary fashion scene in Shibuya extends northward from Shibuya Station to Harajuku, where youth culture reigns; Omotesandō, the zelkova tree- and fashion brand-lined street; and Sendagaya, Tokyo's apparel design district.
     During the late 1990s, Shibuya also became known as the center of the IT industry in Japan. It was often called "Bit Valley" in English,[citation needed] a pun on both "Bitter Valley", the literal translation of "Shibuya", as well as bit, the computer term for binary digits. </p>

     <h2 id="Cross">Shibuya Crosswalk</h2>
     <hr>
     <p>Tokyo (CNN) — Often referred to as the world's busiest crosswalk, thousands of pedestrians scramble across Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing daily.
At peak times, the hypnotic pace of the changing traffic light seems to signal the masses into a mesmerizing, yet claustrophobic, waltz.
For many, the controlled chaos of Shibuya's "Scramble" epitomizes the efficient madness of the cutting-edge city. Here, 10 lanes of traffic and five major crosswalks converge along a modern canyon of neon-colored buildings in the heart of Tokyo.
The Shibuya Crossing serves as center-stage for a Times Square-inspired New Year's Eve countdown and is the focal point for the wild Halloween celebrations that have grown increasingly famous in recent years.</p>
     <br><br>
     <p>Its popularity is easily explained.
Along with Shinjuku Station, the district's Shibuya Station bears the honor of being one of the world's busiest train stations.
Connecting to popular areas such as Shinjuku, Harajuku and Roppongi, it's almost impossible to bypass Shibuya on a visit to Tokyo or even a trip across town. And you wouldn't want to, anyway.Movie buffs will appreciate the fact that "The Fast and the Furious" famously slid through the technicolor crossing in the movie series' third installment "Tokyo Drift."
Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray fans may remember the "Lost in Translation" film scene featuring a sea of clear umbrellas overtaking the intersection. And in the Japanese cult classic "Battle Royale," the crossing stood as a futuristic cityscape in the flick.
Models, and those who would be, strut through the crossing as if on a personal catwalk. It's not uncommon to spot a mascot shimmying across, and there always seems to be a heat of MariCar racers zipping by. It's both a place to see and be seen.
Even during major events such as Halloween, the street remains functional with officials squeezing people onto the sidewalks with retractable ropeways. No matter how busy, traffic at this massive intersection is rarely congested. Emergency vehicles even make their way through rush hour crossings with ease.</p>
