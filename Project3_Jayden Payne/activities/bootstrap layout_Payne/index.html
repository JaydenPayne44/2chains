            <img src="images/borma.jpg" alt="pic2" title="Borma" style="width:100%"> </div>
        <h4>Borma</h4>
        <p> <strong>Borma</strong> is Section 9's resident explosives specialist, as shown several times during 2nd GIG. He is the only Section 9 operative with similar height and enhanced strength to Batou, though his optics are clearly a different color and might therefore be another model with different capabilities. Both his eyes and his baldness are his trademark features.  </p>
      </div>

  <div class="col-sm-2 ">
          <div class="card2">
          <img src="images/batou.jpg" alt="pic3" title="Batou" style="width:100%"> </div>
        <h4>Batou</h4>
        <p> <strong>Batou</strong> is a main male character in Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell series. He is the second-best melee fighter in Section 9, and is the second in command under Major Motoko Kusanagi. He is a battle-hardened cyborg special operative with a long distinguished military career and a no-nonsense attitude  </p>
      </div>

    <div class="col-sm-2">
          <div class="card2">
            <img src="images/daisuke.jpg" alt="pic4" title="Daisuke Aramaki" style="width:100%"> </div>
        <h4>Daisuke Aramaki</h4>
        <p> <strong>Lieutenant Colonel Aramaki</strong> is a strict chief, and is referred to by others in Section 9 as the "old ape" (most likely because in the original manga he was drawn with a face that appeared to be half monkey, half man). Even so, he is fiercely loyal to the members of Section 9, and often puts his own career on the line to ensure the survival of the rest of his team. </p>

              <img src="images/saito.jpg" alt="pic5" title="Saito" style="width:100%"> </div>
          <h4>Saito</h4>
          <p> <strong>Saito</strong> is a fictional character from the anime series Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C.. Section 9's resident tactical sniper is an exceptional crack-shot with very few cyberized implants. He can handle any automatic firearm with deadly accuracy and precision. </p>
