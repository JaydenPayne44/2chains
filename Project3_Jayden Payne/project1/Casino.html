    <p>Gambling's what this place is known for. If you come to town and don't pull an arm, hold some cards or toss some dice, we have to question if you really lived it up at all. And it's OK. If you're new to the scene, we have some tips for you. Bet you didn't know this. When things got ugly during the Great Depression (mining was petering out, and people were leaving the state like barflies when the lights flicker), Nevada had a brilliant idea. They said: "Dudes. Stay. As of now gambling is legal. And guess what? So is divorce!" With two gems like that, who needed silver? Suddenly and forever after, Las Vegas was the promised land. Still today, you can gamble to your heart's content. And get divorced (and married) whenever you want too.

      In 1989 longtime casino developer Steve Wynn opened the Mirage, the city’s first mega-resort. Over the next two decades the strip was transformed yet again: Old casinos were dynamited to make room for massive complexes taking their aesthetic cues from ancient Rome and Egypt, Paris, Venice, New York and other glamorous escapes.

      Casinos and entertainment remained Las Vegas’ major employer, and the city grew with the size of the resorts and the numbers of annual visitors. In 2008, even as residents faced recession,rising unemployment and a housing price collapse, the city still received nearly 40 million visitors.</p>
